The code uses the OpenCV and mediapipe libraries to detect hands in video frames captured by a webcam. The script defines a handDetector class that provides an interface to the mediapipe library. The class has several methods:

__init__: This is the class constructor, which is executed when an object of the class is created. It takes several parameters:

__mode__: A boolean value that indicates whether to run the hand detection in GPU or CPU mode.

__max_hands__: The maximum number of hands that should be detected in a frame.

__detection_confidence__: The minimum confidence level that should be used for hand detection.

__track_confidence__: The minimum confidence level that should be used for hand tracking.



Inside the constructor, it loads the Hands and drawing_utils solutions from mediapipe package and creates an instance of Hands class.


__find_hands__: This method takes an image and a boolean value as input and returns the image with drawn landmarks on the detected hands. It first converts the image from BGR to RGB format, then it processes the image using the process method of the Hands class which returns the results containing the landmarks of the detected hands.

__find_position__: This method takes an image and an integer value as input and returns the list of landmarks of the hands. It takes the results obtained from the process method of the Hands class and iterates through the landmarks of each hand, extracting the x and y

In VOLUME TRACKER


The code captures video feed from the default camera and applies the hand detection module from HandTrackingModule to detect hands in the frame. It then finds the position of the hand's landmarks, specifically the thumb and the finger, and uses the distance between them to control the volume of the system's audio output.

The first block of code imports necessary libraries such as OpenCV, numpy and the HandTrackingModule. It also imports classes for controlling audio output volume.

The next block of code sets the width and height of the camera being used.

The following block of code uses the AudioUtilities class to get the speakers and activate the IAudioEndpointVolume interface to control the audio output volume. It also gets the minimum and maximum volume range.

The next block of code captures video feed from the default camera and sets its width and height.

It then creates an instance of the handDetector class from HandTrackingModule, passing in a detection confidence of 0.7. It also initializes variables to keep track of the previous and current times, and the current volume level.

In the while loop, the program captures a frame from the camera, applies hand detection on it using the find_hands method from the handDetector instance and finds the position of the hand landmarks using the find_position method.

It then calculates the x,y coordinates of the thumb and finger and the center of the line between them. It also calculates the length of the line between the thumb and finger and uses it to control the audio output volume. The volume level is calculated by interpolating the length of the line between the thumb and finger with the volume range using numpy's interp function.

The program also displays the current volume level as a percentage, as a filled rectangle on the video feed, and the current fps. The final frame is displayed on the screen using cv2.imshow(). The program waits for a key press using cv2.waitKey(1) and continues capturing video frames until the key press.
