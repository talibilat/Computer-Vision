The code uses the OpenCV and mediapipe libraries to detect hands in video frames captured by a webcam. The script defines a handDetector class that provides an interface to the mediapipe library. The class has several methods:

__init__: This is the class constructor, which is executed when an object of the class is created. It takes several parameters:

__mode__: A boolean value that indicates whether to run the hand detection in GPU or CPU mode.

__max_hands__: The maximum number of hands that should be detected in a frame.

__detection_confidence__: The minimum confidence level that should be used for hand detection.

__track_confidence__: The minimum confidence level that should be used for hand tracking.



Inside the constructor, it loads the Hands and drawing_utils solutions from mediapipe package and creates an instance of Hands class.


__find_hands__: This method takes an image and a boolean value as input and returns the image with drawn landmarks on the detected hands. It first converts the image from BGR to RGB format, then it processes the image using the process method of the Hands class which returns the results containing the landmarks of the detected hands.

__find_position__: This method takes an image and an integer value as input and returns the list of landmarks of the hands. It takes the results obtained from the process method of the Hands class and iterates through the landmarks of each hand, extracting the x and y
